  Artificial Intelligence and machine learning
  Artificial intelligence & Machine Learning is an allied branch of Computer Science which focuses on technology for creating intelligent machines which can think and work like human beings. AI is a technology which enables a machine to simulate human behavior. ML is a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn from past data without programming explicitly. The goal of AI is to make a smart computer system like humans to solve complex problems. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
  It is a Blooming technological advancement, from software’s like Alexa, to basic human command system. But going by the bounds of progress AI has been making permeate in every sphere of our life. Every aspect of these technologies has been put to its best use. It is now spinning as a basic part of human lives. People need this technology in enterprises and even households. Artificial intelligence has made its way through all sectors of society. Every person is using this technology in some or the other way. Moreover, it is modified for different age groups and industrial sectors.
